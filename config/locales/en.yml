    awards:
      award_1: The Best Team Name Medal
      award_10: The Invisibility Cloak
      award_10_description: Awarded to the team who remained undercover and underground. You reported the action but left no trace. Think chameleons, termites hard at work where no one can see, mushrooms springing up with no warning and disappearing just as quickly. The most spectacular cloak-and-dagger action wins this award! Although of course we won’t ever know if you came to the award ceremony to pick it up.
      award_11: The Big Splash Cup
      award_11_description: Congratulations! You made the news headlines – everyone is talking about your action around the water cooler. Awesome pictures of your team’s mission are being tweeted faster than your post-adventure heartbeat. While your friends wearing the Invisibility Cloak moved like a barely-perceptible ripple on the surface of the water, you were busy performing in the spotlight. An unforgettable image that tells a catchy story is all you need to win this award, but a good dose of courage, creativity and cheek won’t do any harm.
      award_12: The Insurrectionary Innovation Badge
      award_12_description: Untangle your imagination from the Mesh. Win this award by causing beautiful trouble and inventing forms of creative disobedience the world has never seen before. It might be vivid colours and costumes, quirky choreography and hoaxes, parties in strange places, stunning sounds and irresistible tactics…. If you’re thinking of holding a march or a rally, no need to apply here.
      award_13: The Cup for Best Crowd Choreography
      award_13_description: Your team knows how to move. Even better it enables other people to groove together and take part in the adventure with you. You are a herd of antelopes leaping, a mischief of scampering mice. You are a watch of nightingales gliding across the horizon, a nuissance of cats springing into the night. Get the movements moving, and the Cup is yours.
      award_14: The Electronic Disobedience Medal
      award_14_description: You might be a team of one or a gaggle of geeks, you might like to sit in your bedroom fingers at the ready, tapping code, testing portals. This Award is for the most effective form of electronic disobedience that takes place within the networks of the Mesh during the Games. Combining street and cyberspace action is always a winning formula.
      award_15: The Plan B Badge for Spontaneity
      award_15_description: 'You turned up on the day and everything went wrong: your team got lost, you went to the wrong place, you forgot the props or Team Blue managed to get there first. But it doesn’t matter because you had a plan B (or at least the power of spontaneity) and just went for it, keeping everyone’s safety in mind and your nerves intact.'
      award_16: The Carry On Resisting Trophy
      award_16_description: You don’t win with one action, but by building a resilient movement that never goes home. This award is for acts which leave a legacy, seeds sown for the long term. Perhaps you opened up space, constructed a new territory, invented new forms of life that will carry on despite the Mesh. Let’s build the structures and tools now to keep on going tomorrow and beyond. The future needs us!
      award_1_description: Every gamer and onlooker will have the chance to nominate the team with the best name. In the Amsterdam games, there were the Rubberduck Armada, Dirty Lil Monkeys and Vegan Grill Masters. We are sure that for COP21 teams will come up with names that tickle us from the inside.
      award_2: The Hive Mind Award
      award_2_description: Like a swarm of ants scattering across the territory, you are leaving trails to the many forms of the Mesh. To win this prize you will have photographed and reported, traced and mapped the Mesh’s manifestations onto the game space. You are the intelligence of the games; without you and your intel reports we are nothing.
      award_3: The Award for Ultimate Unexpectedness
      award_3_description: The Mesh wants to know where you are and what you are doing – always! That plastic thing in your hand works very hard for the Mesh’s security minions. To control things you need information, predictions, knowledge. The thing that disturbs the Mesh most however is being taken by surprise. You get this award for the action that no one expected. Don’t forget to take yourself by surprise too!
      award_4: The Courage Is Contagious Cup
      award_4_description: Respect your comfort zone but don’t be afraid to explore the edges, that’s where things change. No struggle has ever been won without daring to jump into the unknown. Courage comes from the heart, from within, but don’t worry, your team is there for you – together you can win this trophy.
      award_5: The Pissed Myself Cup
      award_5_description: Awarded to the team who made us LOL, who know that transforming the world has to be fun. Think the pleasure principle, playfulness, priceless pranks. Taking yourself too seriously will not win you this award.
      award_6: The Most Effective Action Award
      award_6_description: Win this award if your gameplay results in a significant impact and disruption in the flows of the Mesh. Think immediate CO2 reductions, dismantling critical nodes of toxic power and blocking industry lobbyists. Your action will not just be communicative but must have a concrete material effect.
      award_7: The Future Now Prize
      award_7_description: Awarded to the team who builds new worlds in the shell of the old, embodying solutions in the present. Think planting disobedient gardens, sharing something for free, experiencing the collective joy of horizontality. Don’t wait for the revolution, live as if you were already free.
      award_8: The Copcop Spotters Badge
      award_8_description: 'This is a badge for the eagle-eyed observers or moles making their moves underground! You scan the streets for the Mesh’s sidekick, Team Blue. With a mobile phone in your hand and a bike between your legs you are reporting Team Blue’s every move, as it tries to obstruct us playing the Games. Take pictures/videos of any of their abusive behaviour, mark positions on the map and enable the flow of resistance. But be specific: How many? Are they moving or stationary? What mood are they in? etc… No need to cause unnecessary panic!'
      award_9: The Solidarity and Symbiosis Award
      award_9_description: 'The tendency in ecosystems is to associate, build relationships, and cooperate. They are symbiotic networks of mutual support. The team winning this award will have been cooking meals for rebels, helping with legal support, scouting for a team, healing and nurturing others. You are the dance of the wasp and the orchid, clownfish swimming with the sea anemones. You might even create dazzling diversions for Team Blue to help another team succeed. Remember: we can only win the Games together.'

        introduction: |
          <p>The Climate Games COP21 have seen more than 120 teams organising 140 beautiful, quirky, funny, courageous, disobedient actions. And as each team selected the awards that best represented their action (and fellow teams chose the awards they felt they really deserved), we had a fantastic list of nominations that was presented to a delirious crowd during the unforgettable Awards Ceremony that took place on December 13th.
          For each award, two finalists were presented to the public which was tasked with deciding between them through a magnificent fox-powered-clap-o-metre. Obviously it was often extremely difficult to choose, so there have been honourable mentions, ties, and even surprise winners.</p>

          <p>Here is the recap list of them all…</p>

        climate_catastrophe_unraveling: 'The climate catastrophe is unraveling our life support systems and dispossessing communities everywhere. And this is just the beginning. For 20 years (hence COP21) the same players have been playing by the same rigged rules: “business as usual”. The only thing that has come out of the talks is hot air and a rise of CO2 emissions of over 60%. This absurd show cannot be left unchallenged.'
        climate_justice_movement_rising: A climate justice movement is rising (even faster than the temperatures and sea levels!) and Paris will be a world stage where we, people power, raise the curtain on the smoke and mirrors of false corporate promises and pierce through the Mesh’s hold on us.
